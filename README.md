# Quick-Start-Guides
 In this repository I have all the coding projects and assignments that I have completed or are working on.

  <h1> What is Quick-Start-Guides?</h1>
  <p>Quick-Start-Guides is a self-paced online programming curriculum with guides and tutorials designed to introduce new programmers to key programming concepts and tools using HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL languages.

  <h1> What I learned while going through the Quick-Start-Guides Program?</h1>

  <h2>Introduction to Programming</h2>
  <p>
   I received an introduction to fundamental programming concepts and best practices. I gained an understanding of what programming is and how it is used in real-world applications. I was introduced to key concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures (loops and conditionals), as well as syntax, functions, and error handling.

  <h2>Web Development Fundamentals</h2>
  <p>
    Quick-Start-Guides is divided into three parts: HTML & CSS, Python, and SQL. In the Python section, I learned basic syntax, data types, functions, and error handling. In the HTML & CSS section, I was shown how to use variables, data types, functions, control structures, the structure of web pages, and common HTML tags. This was reinforced by writing scripts to perform basic tasks and solve problems, creating and querying small databases, styling web pages, using selectors, applying styles, adding event listeners, and handling user interactions.

  <h2>Introduction to API's</h2>
  <p>
   The course included an introduction to APIs, which gave me an understanding of what APIs are, how they are used, and their practical applications. This was further developed by making simple API calls and handling responses. An example of this in practice was fetching data from a public API and displaying it in a web application.

  <h2>Best Practices and troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>
    This program included a section on debugging. I learned common debugging practices and tools, which helped me understand and resolve common programming errors. This ensured that I developed clean and maintainable code. As I continued to learn, I developed skills in documenting code for clarity and collaboration on projects.

  <h2>Buidling Sample Projects</h2>
  <p>
    As the program continued, I was shown mini-projects. These were simple, guided projects that integrated various elements learned throughout the course. Some of these included building a basic calculator, a to-do list app, and a simple web page with interactive features.
