# Quick-Start-Guides
 In this repository I have all the coding projects and assignments that I have completed or are working on.

  <h1> What is Quick-Start-Guides?</h1>
  <p>Quick-Start-Guides Programming Curriculum is a self-paced online program with guides and tutorials to introduce new programmers to key programming concepts and tools when using HTML,CSS, Python, and SQL languages.

  <h1> What I learned while going through the Quick-Start-Guides Program?</h1>

  <h2>Introduction to Programming</h2>
  <p>
   I was given an Introduction to fundamental programming concepts and best practices. I was given an understadning on what programming is and how it is used in real-world applications. I was introduced to key concepts such as variables, data types, operators, control structures (loops and conditionals). As well as syntax, data types, functions, and error handling.

  <h2>Web Development Fundamentals</h2>
  <p>
    Quick-Start-Guide is broken into 3 parts: HTML & CSS, Python, and SQL. In the Python sections I was shown basic syntax, data types, functions, and error handling. In the HTML & CSS I was show how to use variables, data types, functions, control structures, structure of web pages, common HTML tags.  This was all then reinforced via writing scripts to perform basic tasks and solve problems, creating and querying a small databases, styling web pages, using selectors, applying styles, adding event listeners and handling user interactions.

  <h2>Introduction to API's</h2>
  <p>
    While doing this course there was an introduction to API's. This gave me an understanding of what API's are, how they are used, and practical applications. This was further developed by making simple API's calls and handling responses. An example of this in practice was fetching data from a public API and displyaing it in a web application.

  <h2>Best Practices and troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>
    This program contained a section in debugging.  I learned common debugging practices and tools. As I accomplished this I developed the ablity to understand and resolving common programming errors. This ensured that I developed clean and maintainable code. As I continued to learn, I developed the skills to use basic documenting code when it comes to projects for clarity and collaboration.

  <h2>Buidling Sample Projects</h2>
  <p>
    As the program contined were shown mini-projects. These were simple, guided projects that integrated various elements learned throughtout the bundle. Some of these included building basic calculator, a to-do list app, and a simple web page with interactive features.
